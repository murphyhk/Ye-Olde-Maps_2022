# Ye Olde Maps

A Waikato University COMPX241 Project 2022

Members: Aryan Thanki, Hannah Murphy, Aibel Antony, Ethan Macleod
Project Manager: Kenan Grant

Overview:
  We were tasked with finding a new inovative way to use google maps by incorperating 
  old world elements to show the historical progress cities have made. The target 
  audience for this project was University scholars or historians as they could better
  see the comparisions of historical locations. The Google map displays the modern day
  satellite imagery of Berlin city with ground overlays of historial maps from different 
  time periods.
